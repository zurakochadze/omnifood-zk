A landing page for a fictional AI food startup. A final project for <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/" target="_blank">the Udemy course</a>. I built the project from scratch, redesigned a bit and added some nuances.

# Here's some key things I did:

- Built a layout utilizing grid, flexbox and other modern CSS features.
- Made the website completely responsive using Media Queries.
- Create a Hamburger menu.
- Implemented smooth scrolling using Javascript for accessibility reasons.
- Implemented revealing on scroll feature (using IntersectionObserver API).
- Created sticky navigation (using IntersectionObserver API).
- Created a pricing toggle for monthly and yearly subscriptions.
- Created an accordeon FAQ element (a new section added by me).
